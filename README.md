# ESPSmsA6Transceiver

A C++ ESP8266/Arduino library for communicating with the AI-Thinker A6 GSM module.

## Details

This library is an adaptation of
[the A6lib library](https://github.com/skorokithakis/A6lib). It is still
very incomplete, but at least it works somewhat. Please feel free to issue pull
requests to improve it.
